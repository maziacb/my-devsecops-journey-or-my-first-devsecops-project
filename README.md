# My DevSecOps Learning Journey

This repository chronicles my hands-on learning path in DevOps and DevSecOps.
I'll be documenting my projects, configurations, and automation scripts here.

## My North Star Project Idea:

**Goal:** To deploy a simple web application to the cloud, using containers (Docker/Kubernetes), automated CI/CD pipelines, and integrating security best practices throughout the process.

## Today's Progress (July 11, 2025):

* GitHub account created and first repository initialized.
* Solving a push and commit error
* I am currently trying how git add, git commit and git push works. 
* All documentation here is synced using git cmd.
*
